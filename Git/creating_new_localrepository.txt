sudo yum install git
sudo mkdir -p /opt/ecommerce.git
cd /opt/ecommerce.git
git init --bare
This will create a new Git repository at /opt/ecommerce.git. The --bare flag indicates that this is a shared repository that is not meant to be checked out directly on the server.

You can then add files and push them to the repository as you would with any other Git repository.
